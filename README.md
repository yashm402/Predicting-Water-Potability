# Predicting-Water-Potability
Predicting Water Potability in R

Safe water is important for public health. In 2010, the UN General Assembly recognized the human right to water and sanitation. The consequences to inadequate access to water can have enormous impacts to the physical and economic health of communities.
The aim of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of a multivariate nonparametric technique of classification trees for identifying the selecting the most important factors affecting water potability.

Topics Covered:

•	High dimensionality method:
–	decision tree
•	ROC curve
